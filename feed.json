It is this latter work that earned him The Nobel Peace Prize in 1975 \"<a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/1975/sakharov/facts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">for his struggle for human rights in the Soviet Union, for disarmament and cooperation between all nations.</a>\" </p>\n<div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"370\" src=\"https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline3/latest/embed/index.html?source=1j4ljdOWkRBF554PG6KYLFQcISCkBmk9OQa-5mI8fnVM&amp;font=Default&amp;lang=en&amp;initial_zoom=2&amp;height=370\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1fm9lusf4t3\">Contribution to Soviet Nuclear History</h2>\n<p>Beginning with his student days at the Moscow State University, Sakharov was believed to be one of the most brilliant students in the history of the physics department.

He then began work on the H-bomb which was first tested as RDS-37 in 1955 and subsequently as what became known as Tsar Bomba in 1961.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EHRLEMTsLyA\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1fm9lusf4t4\">Political Activism</h2>\n<p>While at first <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Sakharov_Speaks.html?id=nElpAAAAMAAJ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sakharov believed</a> in the \"vital importance of creating a Soviet super-weapon -- for our country [the Soviet Union] and for the balance of power throughout the world,\" it is around this time that his concerns around the dangers of nuclear weapons began to emerge. In 1973, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/04/archives/the-intolerable-andrei-sakharov-ideological-bombshells-from-an.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>The New York Times</em>' Hedrick Smith quoted Sakharov</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I gradually began to understand the criminal nature not only of nuclear tests, but of the enterprise, as a whole. I began to look on it and on other world problems from a broader, human perspective.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sakharov tried his best to convince General Secretary Khrushchev in 1958 to stop large-scale nuclear tests, but, alas, he did not succeed. Three years later, Sakharov tried again with a note to General Secretary Khrushchev that <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Sakharov_Speaks.html?id=nElpAAAAMAAJ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">said</a>: \"to resume tests after a three-year moratorium would undermine the talks on banning tests and on disarmament, and would lead to a new round in the armaments race -- especially in the sphere of intercontinental missiles and anti-missile defense.\" General Secretary remained unconvinced.  </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It was terrible. I had an awful sense of powerlessness. I could not stop something I knew was wrong and unnecessary. After that, I felt myself another man. I broke with my surroundings. It was a basic break. After that, I understood there was no point in arguing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Feeling responsible for the lives impacted and lost due to nuclear test explosions as well as for the environmental damage, Sakharov fought earnestly until the 1963 Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty to which the U.S., the U.K., and the Soviet Union signed on after many years of negotiation.</p>\n<p>Sakharov remained dedicated to various social causes and in June 1968 (following Prague Spring and Soviet invasion into Czechoslovakia), he published his first book <em>Progress, Coexistence, and Intellectual Freedom</em>, in which he discussed the dangers of thermonuclear war, hunger, poverty, freedom of thought and expression, pollution, and outlined steps for potential cooperation between the U.S. and the Soviet Union.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/10_Soviet_Invasion_of_Czechoslovakia_-_Flickr_-_The_Central_Intelligence_Agency.jpg/1600px-10_Soviet_Invasion_of_Czechoslovakia_-_Flickr_-_The_Central_Intelligence_Agency.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"During the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, Czechoslovaks carry their national flag past a burning tank in Prague.\" width=\"900\" height=\"605\">\n<figcaption >During the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, Czechoslovaks carry their national flag past a burning tank in Prague.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Following the publication of the book, Sakharov was removed from secret state projects in August 1968. </p>\n<p>Having been present at political trials of Soviet dissidents, Sakharov <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Sakharov_Speaks.html?id=nElpAAAAMAAJ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">concluded</a> that \"what we [the Soviet Union] need is the systematic defense of human rights and ideals and not a political struggle, which would inevitably incite people to violence, sectarianism, and frenzy.\"</p>\n<p>The next publication was a 1975 book called <em>My Country and the World</em>, the same year that Sakharov received the Nobel Peace Prize which his wife Yelena Bonner accepted on his behalf.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"144\" src=\"https://www.svoboda.org/embed/player/0/29041057.html?type=audio\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n<p>Throughout Sakharov's career as a humanist, he was not treated kindly by the Soviet Union. Confrontational relationship culminated in Sakharov and his wife being detained and exiled to Gorky (Nizhnii Novgorod) for 6 years during which Sakharov went on prolonged hunger strikes three times. </p>\n<p>Finally, in 1988, Sakharov was able to go on his first trip abroad to the West and meet with U.S. Presidents Reagan and Bush, French President Mitterrand, and British Prime Minister Thatcher. </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/Reagan_Sakharov.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"U.S. President Reagan and Andrei Sakharov.\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\">\n<figcaption >U.S. President Reagan and Andrei Sakharov.

His parting words in <em><a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/My_Country_and_the_World.html?id=PklpAAAAMAAJ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">My Country and the World</a></em> where he discusses his global realities echo much of what activists say today about the present state of global affairs:</p>\n<p>\"The reality of the contemporary world is complex, with many planes. It is a fantastic mix of tragedy, irreparable misfortune, apathy, prejudices, and ignorance, plus dynamism, selflessness, hope, and intelligence. The future may be even more tragic. Or it may be more worthy of human beings -- better and more intelligent. Or, again, it may not be at all. It depends on all of us -- people living in the USSR, China, India, the United States, Egypt, Israel, Thailand, Italy, England, France, Japan, Australia, Holland, Germany, Syria, Vietnam, Iran -- in every country in the world. It depends on our wisdom, our freedom from illusion and prejudices, our readiness to work, to practice intelligent austerity, and on our kindness and our breadth as human beings. That wisdom must be manifested in a genuine rapprochement among the countries of the First, Second, and the Third worlds; in overcoming disunity in the name of man and his rights. The future of intelligence, of scientific prediction and progress -- the future of the common weal -- must be realized.\"</p>\n<p> </p>\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y6jXMryOsKg\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"https://yanademeshko.github.io/nuclear_arms_control/brief-history-of-nuclear-arms-control-treaties-2/\">Read previous: Cold War Nuclear Arms Control</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://yanademeshko.github.io/nuclear_arms_control/nuclear-arms-control-in-the-present-2/\">Read next: Nuclear Arms Control in the Present</a></p>",
