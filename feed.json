His centenary arrived during a significant moment of reflection on many recent global events and discussions about the state of human rights around the world. </p>\n<h2>Who was Andrei Sakharov?</h2>\n<p>Having been born to a family of Dmitrii Sakharov, a physics professor, and Yekaterina Sakharova (Sofiano), a daughter of an army general, Andrei Sakharov found his calling first in the development of thermonuclear weapons and then as a political activist concerned with nuclear nonproliferation, peace, and civil liberties. It is this latter work that earned him The Nobel Peace Prize in 1975 \"<a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/1975/sakharov/facts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">for his struggle for human rights in the Soviet Union, for disarmament and cooperation between all nations.</a>\" </p>\n<div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"370\" src=\"https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline3/latest/embed/index.html?source=1j4ljdOWkRBF554PG6KYLFQcISCkBmk9OQa-5mI8fnVM&amp;font=Default&amp;lang=en&amp;initial_zoom=2&amp;height=370\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div>\n<h2>Sakharov's Contribution to Soviet Nuclear History</h2>\n<p>Beginning with his student days at the Moscow State University, Sakharov was believed to be one of the most brilliant students in the history of the physics department. Following the end of his studies, Sakharov began to work at the prestigious Lebedev Institute of Physics of the Soviet Academy of Science under the future Nobel laureate Igor Tamm. </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/LPI_RAS_Nobel_laureats.jpg/1600px-LPI_RAS_Nobel_laureats.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Seven Soviet and Russian Nobel laureates who worked at the Lebedev Physics Institute of the Academy of Sciences: Cherenkov, Tamm, Frank, Basov, Prokhorov, Sakharov, Ginsburg.

He then began work on the H-bomb which was first tested as RDS-37 in 1955 and subsequently as what became known as Tsar Bomba in 1961.</p>\n<div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" controls=\"controls\" light=\"{true}\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YtCTzbh4mNQ?start=1\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<p>It is around this time that Sakharov's concerns around the dangers of nuclear weapons began to emerge. In 1973, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/04/archives/the-intolerable-andrei-sakharov-ideological-bombshells-from-an.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>The New York Times</em>' Hedrick Smith quoted Sakharov</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I gradually began to understand the criminal nature not only of nuclear tests, but of the enterprise, as a whole. I began to look on it and on other world problems from a broader, human perspective.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sakharov tried his best to convince General Secretary Khrushchev to stop large-scale nuclear tests, but, alas, he did not succeed. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It was terrible. I had an awful sense of powerlessness. I could not stop something I knew was wrong and unnecessary. After that, I felt myself another man. I broke with my surroundings. It was a basic break. After that, I understood there was no point in arguing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, in June 1968, Sakharov published his famous manifesto <em>Progress, Coexistence, and Intellectual Freedom</em>, in which he called for an end of the arms race and for the U.S. and the Soviet Union to put their vast resources together in order to help the world fight issues such as hunger, uneven development, racism, militarism among others. </p>\n<p>The year of 1975 was another significant year of Andrei Sakharov, for it is when he published his book <em>My Country and the World</em> and received the Nobel Peace Prize which his wife Yelena Bonner accepted.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://d2zofuu73zurgl.cloudfront.net/vnikitskom/cloned-images/auction_117/lots/import_0/692/1/a_ignore_q_80_w_400_h_400_c_fit_1.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"\" width=\"259\" height=\"400\"></figure>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://yanademeshko.github.io/nuclear_arms_control/brief-history-of-nuclear-arms-control-treaties-2.html\">Read previous: Cold War Nuclear Arms Control</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://yanademeshko.github.io/nuclear_arms_control/nuclear-arms-control-in-the-present-2.html\">Read next: Nuclear Arms Control in the Present</a></p>",
